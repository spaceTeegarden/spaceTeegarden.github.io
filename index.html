    <h1>Dear hannah,</h1>
    <p>
      I know that my words may have disrupted your peace recently. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for how I spoke to you today. My tone was rude, and I realize now how much that must have hurt you. It was never my intention to make you feel annoyed or upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognize that I wasted precious time saying a lot of unhelpful things. My apologies only seemed to make things worse, and I regret that I let you go to bed feeling anything less than cherished. You deserve every bit of kindness and love, and I failed to show you that today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please know that I am truly sorry for my behavior. You mean the world to me, and the last thing I want is to bring negativity into our relationship. I promise to work on my communication and be more mindful of how I express myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being patient with me. I hope we can talk soon. You are an amazing person, and I am so lucky to have you in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all my love,<br>
      christopher
